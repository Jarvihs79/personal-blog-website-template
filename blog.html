            <h1>The Syrian rebels who found refuge in books</h1>
            <h3>:- Shivraj Patil</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">Ahmad Muaddamani was one of 12,000 survivors of Darayya. A city located less than five miles from Damascus, his town was a sarcophagus, surrounded and starved by the regime.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">They had been under fire from Bashar al-Assad’s rockets, barrel bombs and even a chemical weapon attack for many months. Syria’s president had besieged the town since November 2012. Like many others, Muaddamani’s family had packed their suitcases and escaped to a neighbouring town. They begged him to follow. He refused – this was his revolution, his generation’s revolution.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">Muaddamani and other young rebels had stayed, not to defend their city, but  to keep something in it alive.
                One day in late 2013, Muaddamani’s friends called him, they needed some help. They had found books that they wanted to rescue in the ruins of an obliterated house.
                “Books?” he repeated in surprise.
                The idea struck him as ludicrous. It was the middle of a war. What’s the point of saving books when you can’t even save lives?
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">He’d never been a big reader. For him, books smacked of lies and propaganda. After a moment of hesitation, he followed his friends through a gouged-out wall. An explosion had ripped off the house’s front door. The disfigured building belonged to a school director who had fled the city and left everything behind.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">Muaddamani cautiously felt his way to the living room, illuminated by a single sliver of sunlight. The wood floor was carpeted with books, scattered amid the debris. With one slow movement, he knelt on the ground and picked one at random. His nails flicked against the dust-blackened cover, as if against the strings of a musical instrument. The title was in English, something about self-awareness, a psychology book. He turned to the first page, deciphered the few words he recognised. It turned out the subject didn’t matter. He was trembling. His insides turned to jelly. An unsettling sensation that comes with opening the door to knowledge. With escaping, for a second, the routine of war. With saving a little piece, however tiny, of the town’s archives. Slipping through these pages as if fleeing into the unknown.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">Muaddamani took his time standing up, the book against his chest. His entire body was shaking. “The same sensation of freedom I felt at my first protest,” he remembered.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">In subsequent days, the collection effort continued in the ruins of abandoned houses, destroyed offices, and disintegrating mosques. Muaddamani developed a taste for it. With each new hunt for books, he savoured the immense pleasure of unearthing abandoned pages, bringing back to the world life buried in wreckage. They excavated with their bare hands, sometimes with shovels. In all, they were 40 or so volunteers – activists, students, rebels – always at the ready, waiting for the planes to go silent so they could dig in the rubble. They salvaged 6,000 books in one week. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">One
                month later, the collection reached 15,000. The books were short, long, dented, dog-eared, damaged; some were rare and highly sought-after.
                They had to find somewhere to store them. Protect them. Preserve this small crumb of knowledge before it all went up in smoke. By general agreement, a plan for a public library took shape. Darayya never had one under Assad, so this would be the first. “The symbol of a city that won’t bow down – a place where we’re constructing something even as everything else collapses around us,” and Muaddamani added. “Our revolution was meant to build, not destroy.”
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">Fearing reprisals from the regime, the organisers decided this library would be kept in the greatest of secrecy. It would have neither name nor sign. It would be an underground space, protected from radar and shells, where avid and novice readers alike could gather. Reading as refuge. A page opening to the world when every door is locked. After scouring the city, Muaddamani and his friends uncovered the basement of an abandoned building at the border of the frontline, not far from the snipers, but largely spared rocket fire. Its inhabitants were gone. The volunteers hurriedly constructed wooden shelves. They found paint to freshen the dusty walls. They reassembled two or three couches. Outside, they piled a few sandbags in front of the windows, and they brought a generator to provide electricity. For days, the book collectors busily dusted, glued, sorted, indexed and organised all these volumes. Now arranged by theme and in alphabetical order on overstuffed shelves, the books found a new, harmonious order.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">These young Syrians cohabited with death night and day. Most of them had already lost everything – their homes, their friends, their parents. Amid the chaos, they clung to books as if to life, hoping for a better tomorrow, for a better political system. Driven by their thirst for culture, they were quietly developing an idea of what democracy should be. An idea that challenged the regime’s tyranny and Islamic State’s book burners. Muaddamani and his friends were true soldiers for peace.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 26px">So, as the saying goes “Books don’t set limits; they set us free. They don’t mutilate; they restore” Muaddamani and his friends realized the power books hold. books opened the door for them when everything was closed. And one more intresting thing, The most borrowed book from their library was “The Alchemist”(one of my personal favourites too) this international bestseller appealed to the library’s patrons because it describes a notion familiar to them: self-discovery. A Spanish shepherd’s journey from Andalucía to the Egyptian pyramids spoke to them. Darayya’s young revolutionaries heard in this book an echo of their own perilous odyssey. It contained a treasure particularly precious in their eyes: the idea of limitless freedom.
